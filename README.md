## PGTS Verify Tool (Alpha)

Idea: let organizers edit their sheets inline, at the event for players.

### Dev

```
npm install # Get dependencies
npm run dev # Run local server for dev
npm run build # site is outputted to ./out/ directory
```

### Demo

### TODO

- UI
  - Order sheets by event date
  - Make it less ugly
  - Show loading states
  - Navigate between main page and verifying page
- Features
  - View already-verified users in compact list
